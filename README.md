## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lauren Sloane and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Cybersecurity at Quinnipiac University, after completing my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science with a Minor in Criminal Justice. I am passionate, driven, and excel in collaborative work environments. Through my previous experiences, I have consistently demonstrated strong leadership, time management, accountability, and teamwork skills, which I apply to every challenge I take on.
